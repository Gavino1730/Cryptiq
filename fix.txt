‚úÖ Already Done
Set up error alerts/log monitoring: Error logging is implemented (to error_log.json).
Prepare for scaling: Not fully done, but you note the need to move from JSON to a real database in the future.
Sanitize and validate all user input: Some validation is present, but could be improved for edge cases.
Test error handling: Some testing done, but always worth more.
Handle edge cases (missing input, invalid data): Some coverage, but more testing is always good.
Suppress or clean up HTTP request logs in terminal: Partially done; can be further refined.
Test all commands and button flows: In progress; should be done before release.

üü° Partially Done / To Do
Make user data categories consistent: Some improvements, but review for consistency.
Fix timezone display (show actual time/date, not just zone name): Some improvements, but check all user-facing messages.
Fix menu buttons (make /portfolio work via button): Should be tested to confirm.
Automatic user data backups: Not implemented; consider periodic backup or versioning.
Prepare for scaling (use a real database, not JSON): Not yet done, but planned for the future.

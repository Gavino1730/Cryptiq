user data catagories dont match up

timezone doesnt work on graphs just says name of timezone not the date or time

the menu buttons dont work for portfolio but /portfolio works

start separating all the code to make it easier to debug and more organized

have the terminal not output the http requests

get ready to have actual people use it

Refactor & Organize Code

Split code into logical modules (e.g., handlers.py, utils.py, database.py, keyboards.py, main.py).
Remove unused code and add comments/docstrings.
Fix Known Issues

Ensure user data categories are consistent.
Fix timezone handling (show actual date/time, not just the name).
Make sure all menu buttons work as expected.
Suppress or properly log HTTP requests in the terminal.
Testing

Test all features (commands, buttons, error handling) with multiple users.
Handle edge cases and invalid input gracefully.
Security & Privacy

Secure API keys and sensitive data.
Add privacy policy if storing user data.
Validate and sanitize all user input.
Deployment Readiness

Set up logging and error reporting.
Use environment variables for secrets.
Prepare for scaling (consider using a database, not just files).
Documentation

Write a README with setup, usage, and support info.
Document commands and features for users.
Bot Settings

Set a clear bot description, profile photo, and commands in BotFather.
Backup & Monitoring

Set up regular backups for user data.
Monitor uptime and errors.
